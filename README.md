### Introdution to ansible
Automating in IT requires coding skills, time and maintenance. Thats why ansible was made. It's simple, powerful and agentless.
It converts big scripts in few lines of an ansible playbook. 

Imagine you have a bunch of hosts that you want to restart in a particular order and time. Some of them are webservers, file servers, dbs etc.
In a real scenario you have to turn of the webservers, then the dbs and finally the file servers. 
The power on the file servers, dbs and finally the web servers. 

Another example:
Thanks to the built-in modules you can actually spawn multiple vms on private and public clouds. Manage the comunication between them, install application, creating users and managing firewall in no time. 

You can use existing services as DBS for inventories or even enabling tools such as ServiceNow to trigger ansible playbooks over actions.
